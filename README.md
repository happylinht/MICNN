# MICNN
This is a deep learning model on the pulsar dataset HTRU compiled by PYTHON.  It is related to the article " Pulsar Candidate Sifting Using Multi-input Convolution Neural Networks".
The HTRU data set is public by Morello (2014) and available from the link http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~vmorello/

After downloading the HTRU data, run extract_from_HTRU.py to obtain a file of diagnostic images of pulsar candidates. Then, run the file in DataPrepared to preprocess the data of diagnostic images. Finally, run the model in MICNN.
